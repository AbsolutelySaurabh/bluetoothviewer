BluetoothViewer
===============
A simple Android app that can: 1. connect to any Bluetooth device 2.
display incoming raw data 3. send raw data to the Bluetooth device.

The app is intended as a Bluetooth connection debugging tool. You can
confirm successful pairing, monitor incoming raw data and see exactly
what is being transmitted from the Bluetooth device.
